It's always frustrating to use Git because of some wall. I recently read a blog from manateelazycat, he suggests a way to use Git via HTTPS,
just need to edit ~/.ssh/config and add the following config in it

#+BEGIN_SRC
Host github.com
Hostname ssh.github.com
Port 443
User git
#+END_SRC

Test it
#+BEGIN_SRC
‚ùØ ssh -T git@github.com
Hi <USERNAME>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
#+END_SRC
